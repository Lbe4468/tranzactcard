                <p>TranzactCard was created to empower millions of ordinary Americans with access to income and profits normally only available to banks and major financial institutions. It’s a redistribution of wealth that harms no one and benefits everyone.</p>
                <p>When we say ordinary, we really mean extraordinary. And we also mean everyone. Minorities. Women. Men. Young people. Older people. The prosperous. The underbanked and underprivileged. Anyone who spends any amount of money. Anyone who wants
                    more buying power with their available dollars. Anyone who wants more income.</p>
